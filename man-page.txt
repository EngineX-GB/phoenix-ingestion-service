--cmd --batch <feeds_folder>        Load data from feed files.
                                    The directory must have subdirectories that are named in date formats.
                                    Each subdirectory must have the feed files in the correct naming format.
                                    e.g.

                                    --cmd --batch "C:/feeds"
                                    where "C:/feeds" contains subdirectories: "2025-01-01", "2025-01-02"....etc.

--cmd --dynamic <feeds_folder> <config_files_list> <bulk_load_to_staging_table: bool>
                                    Load feed data based on varying columns that are defined by config files.

                                    <feeds_folder>:

                                    The directory must have subdirectories that are named in date formats.
                                    Each subdirectory must have the feed files in the correct naming format.
                                    e.g.


                                    <config_files_list>:

                                    A list of config files that contain the details for what data to load in which
                                    column.

                                    <bulk_load_to_staging_table: bool>

                                    Set to true if the csv data is put into a staging table first before going to
                                    the tbl_client_temp table, or false if it does not go into the staging table and
                                    goes into the tbl_client_temp table directly.

                                    Full example of the command:

                                    --cmd --dynamic "C:\Feeds" "ingestion-col-1.json,ingestion-col-2.json" True

                                    where "C:/feeds" contains subdirectories: "2025-01-01", "2025-01-02"....etc.

 --cmd --anaylse <feeds_folder>     Does not load any data, but analyses the feeds in the subdirectories.

                                    The directory must have subdirectories that are named in date formats.
                                    Each subdirectory must have the feed files in the correct naming format.
                                    e.g.

                                    --cmd --analyse "C:/feeds"
                                    where "C:/feeds" contains subdirectories: "2025-01-01", "2025-01-02"....etc.

 --cmd --custom-load <dated-folder> To load a set of feed files in the dated folder. This folder must contain no
                                    subdirectories and only contain the feed files.

                                    e.g.

                                    --cmd --custom-load "C:\feeds\2025-01-01"

                                    where "C:\feeds\2025-01-01" contains text files that contain the data required to be
                                    loaded.
